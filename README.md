# Wicked TEC-1
## A TEC-1 emulation in JavaScript

There have been a couple of emulations of the TEC-1 over the years. I wondered whether
a good enough one could be written in JavaScript and run directly in a browser. It turns out
that, yes, it most certainly can. You can see the result of my experimentation, a live working version of the TEC-1 [running right here](https://tec1group.github.io/wicked-tec1/index.html)

### Update

This is a complete rewrite of the the Wicked Emulator. It's now written in React.
